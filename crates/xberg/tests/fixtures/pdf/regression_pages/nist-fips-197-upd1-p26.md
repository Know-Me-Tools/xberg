Figures 6, 7, and 8 illustrate KEYEXPANSION() for AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.

# 5.3 INVCIPHER()

To implement INVCIPHER(), the transformations in the specifcation of CIPHER() (Section 5.1) are inverted and executed in reverse order. The inverted transformations of the state — denoted by INVSHIFTROWS(), INVSUBBYTES(), INVMIXCOLUMNS(), and ADDROUNDKEY() — are described in Sections 5.3.1–5.3.4.

INVCIPHER() is described in the pseudocode in Alg. 3, where the array w denotes the key schedule, as described in Section 5.2.
